# Challenge-2-

this repo contains the code for challenge_2, which is following the steps such as read_csv, remove Na and reformat the data for the sorting.
since the goal was creating an application for the team use, i put all the code into a function which needs a data frame as the input then gives the sorted data as the output. And i also uptdate the sorted csv file.
