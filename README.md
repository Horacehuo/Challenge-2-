# Challenge-2-

this repo contains the code for challenge_2, which is following the steps such as read_csv, remove Na and reformate the data fot sorting.
since the goal was creating an application for team use, i put all the code into a function which need a data frame as the input and sorted data as the output. And i also uptdate the sorted csv file.
